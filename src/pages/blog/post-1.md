Welcome to _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I have accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project.
1. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
1. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post âœ¨! I now have pages and Markdown posts!

## What next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
